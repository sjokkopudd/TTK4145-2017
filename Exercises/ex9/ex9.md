- Why do we assign priorities to tasks?

Some taks in a process may be time critical, or necessary to complete for the system to function correctly. If two tasks are ready to be 
executed, and one is time critical, it is natural to assign higher priority to this one, so that it will be completed first int he case that the two tasks
demand the use of the same recources.

- What features must a scheduler have for it to be usable for real-time systems?
